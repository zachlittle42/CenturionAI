# Why We Use Claude as Our Default — And When We Don't

> **TL;DR:** We default to Claude (Anthropic) for most client projects because of output quality, safety, and API reliability. But we switch to GPT or Gemini when the job demands it — coding tasks, multimodal processing, or deep Google ecosystem integration.

## The Honest Answer

Clients ask us this constantly: "Which AI model should we use?"

Our answer is boring but true — it depends. But if you forced us to pick one default, it would be Claude. Not because we have a brand deal. Not because we think Anthropic is going to win some imaginary AI race. Because after hundreds of deployments, Claude consistently produces the best results for the work most businesses actually need done.

Here is what that looks like in practice.

## Why Claude Wins Our Default Spot

### Output Quality for Business Tasks

Most of our clients need AI for business writing, customer communication, document analysis, and strategic reasoning. Claude excels at all of these. The outputs read like they were written by a sharp human, not generated by a machine that learned English from Reddit.

Claude handles nuance well. Ask it to draft a sensitive customer email, and it does not default to corporate platitudes. Ask it to analyze a contract, and it catches the subtleties that matter. This is not a small thing when you are deploying AI into real business workflows where a bad output costs you a customer.

### Safety Without the Straitjacket

Every model has safety guardrails. Some are so tight they make the model useless for real work. Claude strikes the right balance — it will push back on genuinely harmful requests, but it will not refuse to write a competitive analysis because it might hurt someone's feelings.

For our clients in regulated industries — healthcare, finance, legal — this matters. We need a model that is safe enough to deploy responsibly but flexible enough to actually do the job.

### API Reliability

We build production systems. That means uptime matters more than benchmark scores. Anthropic's API has been consistently reliable for us. Response times are predictable. Rate limits are reasonable. When things do go wrong, they communicate clearly.

This is the unglamorous part of choosing an AI model that nobody talks about. Your customers do not care which model scored highest on MMLU. They care that the system works when they click the button.

### Cost Efficiency

Claude's pricing sits in a sweet spot for most business use cases. The Haiku tier handles high-volume, simpler tasks at a fraction of the cost. Sonnet covers the vast majority of production workloads. Opus handles the truly complex reasoning when you need it.

This tiered approach means we can optimize cost per task rather than paying premium prices for everything.

## When We Switch Away from Claude

Here is where we stay honest. Claude is not the best at everything, and pretending otherwise would be a disservice to our clients.

### Heavy Coding Tasks

For pure code generation, debugging, and software engineering workflows, GPT and Gemini often outperform Claude — particularly on complex, multi-file refactoring. When we are building developer tools or code-heavy automations, we test across models and frequently end up choosing a competitor.

### Multimodal Processing

If your project involves heavy image analysis, video processing, or working across multiple media types simultaneously, Gemini has a legitimate edge. Google has been investing heavily in multimodal capabilities, and it shows. When a client needs AI that can look at images and reason about them with high accuracy, Gemini is often our pick.

### Google Ecosystem Integration

If your business runs on Google Workspace and you want AI that integrates natively with Sheets, Docs, Gmail, and Drive, fighting that ecosystem makes no sense. Gemini slots in naturally. We are not going to force Claude into a workflow where Gemini has a structural advantage.

### Speed-Critical Applications

For applications where latency is the primary constraint — real-time chat, instant suggestions, rapid-fire API calls — model choice often comes down to which provider has the fastest response times for your specific region and use case. We benchmark and choose accordingly rather than defaulting.

## How We Actually Decide

Our model selection process is not philosophical. It is practical.

1. **Define the task.** What exactly does the AI need to do?
2. **Test with real data.** We run the client's actual use cases through multiple models.
3. **Measure what matters.** Output quality, latency, cost, reliability — weighted by what the client cares about most.
4. **Build for flexibility.** We architect systems so swapping models later is straightforward, not a rewrite.

That last point is critical. The AI landscape changes fast. The best model today might not be the best model in six months. We build our systems so you are never locked in.

## The Bigger Point

The model wars are entertaining, but they are mostly a distraction. The difference between a well-implemented Claude system and a well-implemented GPT system is usually smaller than the difference between a well-implemented system and a poorly-implemented one.

Execution matters more than model selection. Prompt engineering, system architecture, data pipeline quality, error handling, monitoring — these are the things that determine whether your AI deployment succeeds or fails. The model is one variable among many.

We default to Claude because it gives us the best starting point for most business work. But we will never let brand loyalty override results. If a different model serves you better, that is what we will use.

That is the honest answer.

## FAQ

### Why not just use the newest model from OpenAI?
Newer does not always mean better for your specific use case. We test every major model release against our clients' actual workloads. Sometimes the newest model wins. Sometimes Claude Sonnet still outperforms it at one-third the cost.

### Is Claude safe enough for regulated industries?
Yes, with proper implementation. Claude has strong safety characteristics out of the box, and we add additional guardrails specific to each industry. We have deployed Claude in healthcare and financial services environments successfully.

### Can you switch models after deployment?
Absolutely. We architect every system with model flexibility in mind. Switching typically requires updating configuration and running validation tests, not rebuilding from scratch.

### What about open-source models like Llama?
We use them when they make sense — particularly for high-volume, lower-complexity tasks where hosting your own model reduces long-term costs. But for most business applications, the quality gap still favors proprietary models.

### How much does model choice actually affect cost?
Significantly. The difference between using Claude Haiku for simple tasks versus Claude Opus for everything can be 10-20x in API costs. Smart model routing is one of the highest-ROI optimizations we implement.

### Do you use multiple models in a single system?
Frequently. A typical production system might use a fast, cheap model for classification, a mid-tier model for drafting, and a top-tier model for quality checking. This approach optimizes both cost and quality.

### How often do you re-evaluate your default model choice?
Every quarter at minimum, and whenever a major model release happens. The landscape moves fast, and our recommendations evolve with it.
