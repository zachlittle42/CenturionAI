## Task 1: BUILD — Tech Basics Page (NEW)

**URL:** `/tech-basics`
**Priority:** HIGH — this is the entry-level product for businesses not ready for AI

### Hero Section

```
Get your tech right. Then get it smart.

Before AI can transform your business, your basics need to work. A real website.
A business phone number. Texting that actually reaches customers. Invoicing that
doesn't live in spreadsheets.

We set up the foundation — so when you're ready for AI, everything's already connected.

[Get Started →]
```

### Problem Section

```
Sound familiar?

- Your website was built 5 years ago and you're embarrassed to share it
- Customers call and you miss it — no follow-up, no text-back
- You're juggling Venmo, QuickBooks, and paper invoices
- You know you should be texting customers but don't have a system
- You're paying for 4 different tools that don't talk to each other

You don't need AI yet. You need infrastructure.
```

### What's Included Section

```
Everything your business needs to run. One platform.

YOUR OWN WEBSITE
Modern, mobile-friendly, built to convert. Not a template you can't edit.

BUSINESS PHONE NUMBER
A dedicated line with call tracking, voicemail, and missed-call text-back.
Never lose a lead again.

2-WAY TEXTING
Text customers from your business number. Confirmations, follow-ups,
promotions. They actually open these.

INVOICING
Send invoices, collect payments, track who owes what. No more spreadsheets.

CRM
Every customer, every interaction, one place. Know who called, who booked,
who ghosted.

AUTOMATIONS
Missed a call? They get a text. New lead? Auto-reply in seconds.
Appointment booked? Confirmation sent. It just works.
```

### Pricing Cards

```
ESSENTIALS — $297/mo
Website + phone + texting + CRM + invoicing + basic automations.
"For businesses that need the basics done right."

PROFESSIONAL — $497/mo
Everything in Essentials + reputation management + email marketing +
booking system + pipeline tracking + social media scheduler + priority support.
"For businesses ready to grow."

GROWTH — $797/mo
Everything in Professional + AI chat widget + advanced workflow automations +
custom reporting dashboard + weekly strategy call +
first priority for AI Transformation upgrade.
"For businesses ready to get smart."

All plans: $500 one-time setup. Month-to-month. Cancel anytime.
```

### Upsell CTA Section

```
When the basics are handled, AI becomes easy.

Tech Basics clients get first priority for our AI Transformation services.
Once your systems are connected and your data is flowing, adding AI workflows
is plug-and-play — not a rebuild.

[Explore AI Transformation →]
```

### FAQ suggestions:
- "What platform is this built on?" → "Our proprietary platform — you get a branded login, your own dashboard, and full ownership of your data."
- "Can I keep my current phone number?" → "Yes — we can port your existing number or set up a new dedicated line."
- "What if I outgrow this?" → "That's the plan. Tech Basics is designed to feed directly into our AI Transformation services when you're ready."
- "Is there a contract?" → "No. Month-to-month. Cancel anytime."
- "What's the setup process?" → "We build everything in 5-7 business days. One onboarding call, then we hand you the keys."

## Task 2: BUILD — Strategy Audit Page (currently 404)

**URL:** `/strategy-audit`
**Priority:** HIGH — this is the #1 sales wedge and entry point for consulting

### Hero Section

```
Know exactly where AI fits — before you spend a dollar implementing it.

A focused 30-day assessment that maps every AI opportunity in your business,
estimates ROI for each, and gives you a concrete implementation plan
with your chosen enterprise AI stack.

Not a 200-slide deck. An actionable playbook.

$1,500 — one-time engagement
(Introductory rate — pricing increases after initial client cohort)

[Book Your Audit →]
```

### What You Get Section

```
AI READINESS ASSESSMENT
We evaluate your current tools, workflows, team capabilities, and data
infrastructure. Where are you today, and what's possible?

OPPORTUNITY MAPPING
Every department, every workflow — we identify where AI saves time,
cuts costs, or creates new capabilities. Prioritized by impact and effort.

ROI ESTIMATES
Not hand-wavy projections. Concrete estimates based on your actual team
size, salaries, and workflows. You'll know exactly what each AI
implementation is worth before you spend a dollar.

IMPLEMENTATION PLAN
A step-by-step playbook: which platforms, which workflows, what order,
what timeline. Built around your chosen enterprise AI stack
(Claude, ChatGPT, Gemini, Copilot, or mixed).

PLATFORM RECOMMENDATION
We don't sell software. We recommend what actually fits your team,
your budget, and your existing tools.
```

### How It Works Section

```
01 — KICKOFF CALL (Day 1)
60-minute deep dive into your business, workflows, team structure,
and goals. We learn how you actually work.

02 — ASSESSMENT (Days 2-20)
We audit your tools, observe workflows, interview key team members,
and map every AI opportunity. You keep working — we do the digging.

03 — DELIVERABLE (Days 21-30)
You receive a complete AI strategy document: opportunities ranked by
ROI, platform recommendations, implementation timeline, and budget
estimates. Plus a 60-minute walkthrough call.
```

### CTA Section

```
This is where every engagement starts.

Whether you end up doing AI Transformation, AI Engineering, or
building your own — the audit gives you clarity. Most clients save
the $1,500 in the first month of implementation just by knowing
what NOT to buy.

## Task 4: BUILD — OpenClaw AI Agents Page (currently 404)

**URL:** `/openclaw-ai-agents`
**Priority:** MEDIUM — keep in nav, build dedicated page

### Notes:
- T3 content on the AI Transformation page already has good OpenClaw content
- Expand this into its own page with more detail on:
  - What OpenClaw is (open-source AI agent platform)
  - Use cases: personal assistant, executive coach, business automation agent, customer service agent
  - Self-hosted vs. cloud-managed options
  - Pricing: Self-hosted from $3,000 setup / Cloud-managed from $6,000
  - Live demo or screenshots of an agent in action
- Link to OpenClaw docs/community for credibility

---

## Task 5: UPDATE — Homepage

**Priority:** MEDIUM

### Pricing Cards Update
Reflect new pricing across all three service cards on homepage:
- Strategy Audit: $1,500 (currently correct)
- AI Transformation T1/T2/T3: update to new numbers
- AI Engineering: no change needed

### Add Tech Basics Card
Add a fourth card or a separate section for Tech Basics on the homepage:
```
TECH BASICS
Not ready for AI? Start here.

Website, phone, texting, CRM, invoicing — everything your business
needs to run, in one platform. From $297/mo.

[Learn More →]
```

### Fix "Learn About the Audit" Button
Currently links to 404 Strategy Audit page. Will resolve once Task 2 is complete.

---

## Task 6: UPDATE — Homepage Nav

**Current nav:**
```
Strategy Audit | AI Transformation | AI Engineering | OpenClaw AI Agents | Get Started
```

**New nav:**
```
Tech Basics | Strategy Audit | AI Transformation | AI Engineering | OpenClaw AI Agents | Get Started
```

---

## Task 7: NICE-TO-HAVE (before March 5 Alex meeting)

- [ ] Embed Calendly link in Get Started page "Book a call directly" section
- [ ] Add retainer pricing ladder somewhere visible (AI Transformation page or standalone pricing page)
- [ ] Add logos bar for tools (Claude, ChatGPT, Gemini, Copilot, Cursor, OpenClaw)
- [ ] Add social proof section (even placeholder — "Trusted by X businesses" or a testimonial)

---

## Priority Order for Dev

1. **Tech Basics page** (new build, highest revenue potential at scale)
2. **Strategy Audit page** (404 fix, critical for Alex meeting March 5)
3. **AI Transformation pricing updates** (number changes + retainer section)
4. **Homepage nav + pricing card updates**
5. **OpenClaw AI Agents page** (new build, lower priority)
6. **Nice-to-haves**
